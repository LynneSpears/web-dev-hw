# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Lynne Spears
I'm taking this class to further exercise my skills and get more experience in web developement and design.  I have programmed with html, javascript, and css in the past, but it never hurts to refresh your skills.  Also, the past web development I did was very backend heavy and I was only involved in a little bit of the actual design, so I would like to get more experience with the design side and using css.

The internet is full of surprises:
* It's very complicated yet simple at the same time. When you look at the big picture, it's actually really easy to understand.
* There is so much more involvement in managing a server than I would have thought.
* Most of the information on the internet I already knew, but it was nice to go over it again since it's such a fascinating subject!
