      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
      [Intro]<br/>
      If you were church, I'd get on my knees<br/>
      Confess my love, I'd know where to be<br/>
      My sanctuary, you're holy to me<br/>
      If you were church, I'd get on my knees<br/>
      I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees<br/>
      <br/>
      [Verse 1]<br/>
      Take the pain<br/>
      Make it billboard big and swallow it for me<br/>
      Time capsule for the future<br/>
      Trust me, that's what I will be<br/>
      Oh, the things that you do in the name of what you love<br/>
      You are doomed but just enough<br/>
      You are doomed but just enough<br/>
      <br/>
      [Chorus]<br/>
      If you were church, whoo<br/>
      I'd get on my knees, yeah<br/>
      Confess my love, I'd know where to be<br/>
      My sanctuary, you're holy to me<br/>
      If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees<br/>
      I'd get on my knees, whoo<br/>
      I'd get on my knees<br/>
      I'd get on my knees<br/>
      <br/>
      [Verse 2]<br/>
      I love the world but I just don't love the way it makes me feel<br/>
      Got a few more fake friends<br/>
      And it's getting hard to know what's real<br/>
      And if death is the last appointment<br/>
      Then we're all just sitting in the waiting room (Mr. Stump?)<br/>
      I am just a human trying to avoid my certain doom<br/>
      <br/>
      [Chorus]<br/>
      If you were church, yeah<br/>
      I'd get on my knees<br/>
      Confess my love, I'd know where to be<br/>
      My sanctuary, you're holy to me<br/>
      If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees<br/>
      I'd get on my knees, yeah, oh<br/>
      I'd get on my knees, ah ah ah<br/>
      I'd get on my knees, yeah<br/>
      I'd get on my knees<br/>
      If you were church<br/>
      I'd get on my knees<br/>
      Confess my love, I'd know where to be
      My sanctuary, you're holy to me, you're holy to me<br/>
      If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees, yeah<br/>
