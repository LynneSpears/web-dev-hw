      <h2>How to Draw Hands</h2>
      <p>
        This website's purpose is to introduce beginner artists<br />
        to the basics of drawing one of the hardest body parts, hands.<br />
        For this lesson, you will need materials to draw with,<br />
        whether it's on physical paper or on the computer with a tablet.<br />
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <h3>Step 1:</h3>
      <p>
        When you start drawing a hand, focus on getting the outline down.<br />
        Drawn the shape of the palm first, then drawn the arm extending from<br />
        the palm. Then, we draw a mitten. Don't worry about seperating the fingers<br />
        yet. Just draw them in a group together if they are touching. Overall,<br />
        focus on nailing the general shape of the hand.

      <h3>Step 2:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we have the overall shape of the hand, we can add more details<br />
        and refine our earlier outline. This time, you want to decide where the fingers<br />
        are positioned. It can help to draw a line through the middle of the finger for the<br />
        bone. But for this step, focus on refining that ealier outline, seperating the fingers<br />
        and overall, just putting together the shapes from <i>step 1</i> into a hand.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3:</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we have a more refined sketch, we can really hone in on the details.<br />
        Clean up the refined sketch if needed and add all the details such as fingernails,<br />
        veins, and creases/wrinkles. These are all very useful in shaping the hand. Fingernails<br />
        especially. Fingernails help tell the viewer what way the fingers are facing. Placing<br />
        the fingernails right can be a huge help in getting that hand looking more realistic and<br />
        accurate. But once all the details are added, you are done. You can also then add things like<br />
        rings, scars, <del>or other details</del><ins>bracelets, freckles, moles, or injuries</ins>.

    <!-- Conclusion -->

      <p>
        What I've taught you today is just a brief overview of how I, personally<br />
        draw hands. It is neither the right nor wrong way, and it might not work<br />
        for you. If you are to take anything away from this lesson, I want you to know<br />
        that good art takes practice and persistance. The first hand I drew wasn't perfect<br />
        and neither was the 30th hand I drew. And the hands I draw still aren't perfect.<br />
        But, over time, you will improve and get better. Just stay with it, and you'll improve<br />
        before you know it.
