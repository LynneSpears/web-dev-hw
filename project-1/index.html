    <h3>Cats</h3>
    <h4>A Poem by Charles Baudelaire</h4>

    <hr />

    <p>
      They are alike, prim scholar and perfervid lover:<br />
      When comes the season of decay, they both decide<br />
      Upon sweet, husky cats to be the household pride;<br />
      Cats choose, like them, to sit, and like them, shudder.<br />

      Like partisans of carnal dalliance and science,<br />
      They search for silence and the shadowings of dread;<br />
      Hell well might harness them as horses for the dead,<br />
      If it could bend their native proudness in compliance.<br />

      In reverie they emulate the noble mood<br />
      Of giant sphinxes stretched in depths of solitude<br />
      Who seem to slumber in a never-ending dream;<br />

      Within their fertile loins a sparkling magic lies;<br />
      Finer than any sand are dusts of gold that gleam,<br />
      Vague starpoints, in the mystic iris of their eyes.<br />
